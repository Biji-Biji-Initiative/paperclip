title: Claude Local
summary: Claude Code local adapter setup and configuration
---

The `claude_local` adapter runs Anthropic's Claude Code CLI locally. It supports session persistence, skills injection, and structured output parsing.

## Prerequisites

- Claude Code CLI installed (`claude` command available)
- Auth configured by one of:
  - local Claude subscription login in the runtime `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` or `~/.claude`
  - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` set in the environment or agent config

Use only one billing mode intentionally. If `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is present,
Claude Code uses API-key mode. For subscription billing, leave
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` unset and make sure Claude credential files are present in
the same machine or container that runs the Paperclip server.

## Configuration Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `cwd` | string | Yes | Working directory for the agent process (absolute path; created automatically if missing when permissions allow) |
| `model` | string | No | Claude model to use (e.g. `claude-opus-4-6`) |
| `promptTemplate` | string | No | Prompt used for all runs |
| `env` | object | No | Environment variables (supports secret refs) |
| `timeoutSec` | number | No | Process timeout (0 = no timeout) |
| `graceSec` | number | No | Grace period before force-kill |
| `maxTurnsPerRun` | number | No | Max agentic turns per heartbeat (defaults to `300`) |
| `dangerouslySkipPermissions` | boolean | No | Skip permission prompts (default: `true`); required for headless runs where interactive approval is impossible |

## Prompt Templates

Templates support `{{variable}}` substitution:

| Variable | Value |
|----------|-------|
| `{{agentId}}` | Agent's ID |
| `{{companyId}}` | Company ID |
| `{{runId}}` | Current run ID |
| `{{agent.name}}` | Agent's name |
| `{{company.name}}` | Company name |

## Session Persistence

The adapter persists Claude Code session IDs between heartbeats. On the next wake, it resumes the existing conversation so the agent retains full context.

Session resume is cwd-aware: if the agent's working directory changed since the last run, a fresh session starts instead.

If resume fails with an unknown session error, the adapter automatically retries with a fresh session.

## Skills Injection

The adapter creates a temporary directory with symlinks to Paperclip skills and passes it via `--add-dir`. This makes skills discoverable without polluting the agent's working directory.

## Container Subscription Auth

For Docker/Coolify deployments, seed Claude credentials into the persistent
container home, such as `/paperclip/.claude`, or set `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` to a
profile-specific directory. The adapter snapshots those files for managed remote
runs. If deployment-level `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` exists for fallback tooling, blank
it in subscription-backed agents with `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=` in adapter env. See
[Coolify subscription CLI auth](/deploy/coolify-subscription-auth) for the
deployment checklist.

For manual local CLI usage outside heartbeat runs (for example running as `claudecoder` directly), use:

```sh
pnpm paperclipai agent local-cli claudecoder --company-id <company-id>
```

This installs Paperclip skills in `~/.claude/skills`, creates an agent API key, and prints shell exports to run as that agent.

## Environment Test

Use the "Test Environment" button in the UI to validate the adapter config. It checks:

- Claude CLI is installed and accessible
- Working directory is absolute and available (auto-created if missing and permitted)
- API key/auth mode hints (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` vs subscription login)
- A live hello probe (`claude --print - --output-format stream-json --verbose` with prompt `Respond with hello.`) to verify CLI readiness
